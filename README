The official Befunge-93 specification can be found at http://catseye.tc/projects/befunge93/doc/website_befunge93.html

The differences between Befunge-93 and bfunj are listed below:

- " command is removed
- , command is removed
- ~ command is removed
- g command is removed
- p command is removed

How to use:
b = BFunj.new()
b.load_file 'filename.bfunj'
b.run
puts b.stack.inspect

Options that can be passed to #new:

:input_stream - Defines the input stream, must be a kind_of?(IO). Default is $stdin
:output_stream - Defines the output stream, must be a kind_of?(IO). Default is $stdout
:max_steps - The maximum number of steps to take before program is forced to halt. this prevents infinite loops if. Default is 0 (never force halt).
:filename - Auto-loads the given filename. Default is empty and you must manually load a file with #load_file.
