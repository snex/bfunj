bfunj is a slightly altered Befunge-93 interpreter written in Ruby.

The official Befunge-93 specification can be found at http://catseye.tc/projects/befunge93/doc/website_befunge93.html

The differences between Befunge-93 and bfunj are listed below:

- " command is removed
- , command is removed
- ~ command is removed
- g command is removed
- p command is removed

How to use:
b = BFunj.new()
b.load_file 'filename.bfunj'
b.run
puts b.stack.inspect

You can also change the input/output IO devices used by passing in parameters
to #new, as so:
b = BFunj.new( IO.popen( 'echo 2' ), IO.new( IO.sysopen( '/dev/null', 'w' ), 'w' ) )
This will simply take "2" as an input command should a "&" command show up, and any
output will be dumped into /dev/null. Defaults are $stdin and $stdout respectively.
